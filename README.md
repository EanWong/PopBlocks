<h1>Introduction</h1>

Pop Blocks is a web application used to program the Pop Bot robot of the MIT Media Lab Personal Robots Group. 

Pop Blocks is based of the the MIT Media Lab LLK Group's <a href="https://github.com/LLK/scratch-blocks/wiki">Scratch Blocks</a>. Scratch Blocks is based on Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/blockly">Blockly</a> project. For a full API reference please see Google's Custom Blocks documentation.

<h1>Installation</h1>
Parts taken from Scratch Blocks documentation:
First, download the source code from GitHub. As this project is quickly being updated we recommend you use git but you are more than welcome to download the code directly as well.

Before running the program, you'll need to ensure that you have Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/">Closure Library<a/> installed. If you run into any trouble with this step, or see the following dialog please refer to Google's Blockly documentation.

Once you have the code, point your browser at <code>popr/index.html</code> and verify that blocks can be dragged around.
